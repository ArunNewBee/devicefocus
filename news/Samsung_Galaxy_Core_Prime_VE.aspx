It seems Samsung hasn’t given up with their decision to present more and more budget-friendly Smartphones to the 

Indian Smartphone market, despite the fact that most of its devices are despised for the clumsiness of User Interface 

and the richness in terms of bloatware. Now, the Korean manufacturer has added yet another device to the list, in its 

Galaxy series — Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE! The device is called the new generation Smartphone, by the device 

manufacturer, as it comes with a newer form of display and some other features. We shall have a detailed overview 

of Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE in this post.
</p>

<p class="cntnt">
In terms of design and build, Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE is a typical budget-friendly Smartphone from Samsung, 

as the device has a 4.5-inched display that makes use of WVGA and PLS Technologies at the same time. What has to 

be noted here is that Samsung has used Plane to Line Switching display in the Smartphone, instead of common IPS. It 

is claimed that PLS Display is good at providing better viewing angles and there will be good & deep representation 

of colours as well. In short, the wider screen of 4.5 inches would be impressive in Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE.
</p>

<p class="cntnt">
As in case of build, the device sticks on to the common form factor and design principle of Samsung Mobiles, and the 

mass-segment look of the device is also worth noting, we must say. Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE comes with slim 

design that is accompanied by a matte finish; there are metal sides as well in the device and when we take the case 

of its thinness, Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE really satisfies us — it comes with a 8.8mm thick body, which is good 

at the price range.
</p>

<p class="cntnt">
When we consider the case of performance aspect, the dual-SIM Smartphone has 1GB RAM as well as a quad-core

SoC — clocked at 1.3 GHz —, which offers satisfactory amount of capabilities. There are also proximity sensor and 

accelerometer in device so that you can be as smart as you can. And, talking of storage, Samsung Galaxy Core Prime 

VE has an internal memory of 8GB, although you can’t be sure about how much will be available for your usage. You 

can expand the storage up to 128GB using a Micro-SD card. In case if you are interested in Smartphone photography, 

you would love the 5MP rear camera that’s included and there is a 2MP front camera that can give you good selfie 

shots.
</p>

  <p class="cntnt">
  When we come to the connectivity sector, Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE satisfies the common needs: it comes with

Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth v4.0 and Wi-Fi Hotspot. On top of all these, there’s 3G Connectivity support, to let you 

browse with the maximum speed. To power all these things, Samsung has included a 2000mAh battery, which can be 

effective enough to give you a decent backup time, and the Ultra Power Saving Mode of Samsung can be helpful if 

you need a long-enough backup time.

  </p> 
  
 <p class="cntnt">
 The device is priced at 8600INR, which seems to be way too affordable considering the specifications. However, it is

yet to be seen how effective this Samsung venture would be in the long run, not to mention the clumsy devices we’d 

seen from the same device-maker. You can purchase Samsung Galaxy Core Prime VE from official Samsung store.
