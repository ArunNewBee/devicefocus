Up until this time, Alienware would be the first name to strike in your mind when you decide to get a gaming laptop,

with brilliant specifications and features. Now, however, it seems, Lenovo is all set to enter that market with a brand 

new gaming-oriented laptop — Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK. Lenovo has been quite successful in the market with the 

budget friendly and high-end notebooks, which are so rich in terms of features and capabilities. Now, new venture of 

the China-based consumer electronics manufacturer and launch of the device in India seems impressive enough, we 

would say. Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK was launched during Lenovo India Gaming Week, held in Mumbai and it has a 

lot of things we should talk about.

<p class="cntnt">
At its crux, Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK is a rugged laptop with a 17-inched Full High Definition display. Available for

pre-orders from the coming October, the laptop boasts all the features you would expect from a satisfactory gaming-

oriented device, and is priced at 125000 INR. Apart from the standard high-end specs and powerful build, Lenovo has 

been successful in integrating some specific features that come to be handy for serious gaming enthusiasts out 

there. We will have a look on the specifications of Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK first and then move on to dedicated-

to-gaming features.

When it comes to the performance aspect, Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK has a sixth generation i7 Processor from Intel 

that is meant to give you extreme performance capabilities as well as the power to show stunning visuals like never 

before. This quad-core processor is accompanied by the 16GB DDR4 RAM, giving you much convenience for all your 

games and all. In addition to these, Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK has a 1TB Hard Drive; it also combines 128GB SSD, in 

case if you wanted the laptop to perform well in terms of booting time and stability of performance. Though no sorts 

of games are combined with the device, Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK has a NVIDIA GTX 960M Graphic Solution inside. 

This dedicated graphics card for laptop is a worth-trusting graphics solution when you need uncompromised gaming 

in the end.

  <p class="cntnt">
  In spite of all those improvements in terms of performance, Lenovo has kept the weight of NVIDIA GTX 960M to 3.5 

kilograms, which is relatively low. And the in-built standard battery would give you a backup of 4 hour, which is good 

as you would be doing high-power-consuming tasks using the notebook. And the best part about Lenovo IdeaPad 

Y700 17ISK is that you can choose the specifications according to your taste. For instance, if you wanted a processor 

from AMD, Lenovo gives you the freedom to choose, for that matter. As in case of sound output, you can trust those 

JBL Speakers and Subwoofers Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK comes with. And, to give you better control options as you 

are using it, Lenovo can include a 10-point multi-touch display for the notebook. So, we would say that Lenovo 

IdeaPad Y700 17ISK comprises features that would satisfy a serious gamer and a heavy PC user at the same time.

 <p class="cntnt">
 In the launch event, Lenovo has unveiled some other gaming-oriented accessories as well. These accessories will give 

you best results when you use them with Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK. While the Lenovo Y Gaming Surround Sound 

Headset gives you better sound output — that too in 7.1 channels —, Lenovo Y Gaming Precision Mouse is a feature-

rich mouse that comes with a meticulous design and it won’t tamper your gaming experience, ever. Also, there is a 

mechanical keyboard named Lenovo Y Gaming Mechanical Switch keyboard. This keyboard would be damn superb if 

you are that passionate about playing games. The list isn’t actually complete and there are other accessories waiting. 

The surround headset is available for 5070 INR, while the mechanical switch keyboard wants you to pay 8000INR.

Nevertheless, there’s an offer you should not miss. In the launch event, Lenovo has added that it will be giving away 

accessories worth 9555 INR for those 30 people who pre-order Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 17ISK first. In the event, official 

words from Lenovo talked about the impressive growth of Indian Gaming Industry and it seems we can expect more 

and more devices from Lenovo, in the same category of consumer electronics devices.
