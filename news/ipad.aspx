It isn’t at all common when Apple Inc comes up with a larger version of their always-popular Tablet PC! So, when it does, we will naturally have a lot to talk about as well as to ponder over. Nevertheless, it is what Apple did during the last day’s launch event! It has come up with one revamped version of iPad, with more screen size and stunning features — namely iPad Pro! In this post, you’ll have a brief overview of iPad Pro, discussing various features it comes with.
</p>
<p class="subcaption">The Display — Bigger & More</p>
<p class="cntnt">
As such, iPad Pro is a refreshed version of iPad you have seen! It comes with a screen size of 12.9 inches such that its enlargement would give you better results when it comes to gaming or enterprise-level documents management! An impressive feature that Apple has included in the display aspect is the highest-of-all resolution of 2732*2048 pixel — that is quite higher than the pixel density of a Retina Display-powered Apple MacBook Pro — constituting 5.6 million pixels in the screen. The company also adds that the refreshed iPad has enhanced sensors for more precise detection of touch but it lacks pressure sensitivity. That’s about the display part of it.

<p class="subcaption">Enhanced Performance & Stability</p>
<p class="cntnt">
As we come to the performance aspect, you’d love to find the A9x chip that is included in the third-gen category! As the company calls it, A9x chip can give you enhanced results and more desktop-class performance in the long run. Its performance is said to be faster than 80% of portable PCs out there — well, that 80% includes impressive ones too! It also comes with an 8MP Camera; and, despite all these, weight of iPad Pro is limited to just 1.5 Pounds, which is a big deal when you consider the portability important. To power all these, there’s an impressive battery that gives a battery life of 10 hours, on a single charge.

</p>

<p class="subcaption">Apple Pencil & More</p>
<p class="cntnt">
Apple also adds that the firm has made significant changes to the sound playback aspect. The speakers are not only a bit more powerful but they can sense the environment to give best results. So, that’s all about the hardware part of iPad Pro! Now, there’s Apple Pencil — which is what Apple calls its stylus for iPad. This pressure-detecting stylus will be damn useful, considering the bigger screen size and the fact that some people prefer a stylus to the pointing tool we all have. Of course, this stylus from Apple is worth the deal of $99, as for the build and feel of it.

  <p class="cntnt">
  In addition to its pressure-detection feature, Apple Pencil comes with two sensors, which can add shading affects when you tilt it. In addition, concerning the precision, Apple says the stylus can be precise enough to touch single pixel. Also, Apple has added support for keyboards, which can be connected for better working environments.

<p class="subcaption">iOS — Better Siri, Better Multitasking</p>
 <p class="cntnt">
 Coming to the interface aspect, iPad Pro runs on iOS 9, which comes with superb features such as better capabilities of multitasking in iPad. For instance, there’s Split View, using which you can run two apps simultaneously at a time & Apple demonstrated it quite neatly during the launch. In addition, iOS 9 is accompanied by a better Siri, making her / him an effective personal assistant for you.

  <p class="cntnt">
  So, that’s about the features and capabilities. And, iPad Pro starts from $799 for the Wi-Fi version of it. When you do need more storage space, you have to pay $949 for 128GB version. and, if you prefer having cellular data support, it needs you to pay $1079! In the long run, however, we would say Apple iPad Pro is worth the effort you take, not to mention the stunning features and additional capabilities.
